    Richard Tiffany Gere was born in <a href="">Philadelphia</a> on August 31, 1949,<sup><a href="">[4]</a></sup> the eldest son and second child of homemaker Doris Ann (<a href="">née</a> Tiffany; 1924–2016) and <a href="">NMIC</a> insurance agent Homer George Gere (1922–2023).<sup><a href="">[5]</a><a href="">[6]</a></sup> His father originally intended to become a <a href="">minister</a>.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> Gere was raised <a href="">Methodist</a><sup><a href="">[8]</a><a href="">[9]</a></sup> in <a href="">Syracuse, New York</a>.<sup><a href="">[10]</a></sup> His paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from <a href="">Heavitree</a> and settled in the <a href="">Connecticut Colony</a> in 1638.<sup><a href="">[11]</a></sup> Both of Gere's parents were <a href=""><i>Mayflower</i></a> descendants; his ancestors include <a href="">Pilgrims</a> such as <a href="">John Billington</a>, <a href="">William Brewster</a>, <a href="">Francis Eaton</a>, <a href="">Francis Cooke</a>, <a href="">Degory Priest</a>, <a href="">George Soule</a> and <a href="">Richard Warren</a>.<sup><a href="">[Citation needed]</a></sup>

    In 1967, he graduated from <a href="">North Syracuse Central High School</a>, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> He attended the <a href="">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> on a gymnastics scholarship, studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.<sup><a href="">[7]</a><a href="">[13]</a></sup>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
    Gere first worked professionally at the <a href="">Seattle Repertory Theatre</a> and the <a href="">Provincetown Playhouse</a> on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in <a href=""><i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i></a>. His first major acting role was in the original London stage version of <a href=""><i>Grease</i></a>, in 1973.<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> 
    He was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a <a href="">gay Holocaust victim</a> in the 1979 <a href="">Broadway</a> production of <a href=""><i>Bent</i></a>, for which he earned a <a href="">Theatre World Award</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gere began appearing in <a href="">Hollywood</a> films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in <a href=""><i>The Lords of Flatbush</i></a> (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star <a href="">Sylvester Stallone</a>. He played a small but memorable part in <a href="">Looking for Mr. Goodbar</a> (1977) and starred in director <a href="">Terrence Malick</a>'s well-reviewed drama <a href=""><i>Days of Heaven</i></a> (1978).<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> The crime drama <a href=""><i>American Gigolo</i></a> (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama <a href=""><i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i></a> (1982) (co-starring <a href="">Debra Winger</a>) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million<sup><a href="">[13]</a></sup> and winning two <a href="">Academy Awards</a> out of six nominations;<sup><a href="">[14]</a></sup> Gere himself received his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination.<sup><a href="">[15]</a></sup> For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception.<sup><a href="">[16]</a><a href="">[17]</a></sup> His career rebounded with the releases of <a href=""><i>Internal Affairs</i></a> (1990) and <a href=""><i>Pretty Woman</i></a> (1990), the latter of which earned him his second <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination.<sup><a href="">[18]</a></sup> The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including <a href=""><i>Sommersby</i></a> (1993) (opposite <a href="">Jodie Foster</a>), <a href=""><i>Primal Fear</i></a> (1996) and <a href=""><i>Runaway Bride</i></a> (1999) (which reunited him with his <i>Pretty Woman</i> co-star <a href="">Julia Roberts</a>).<sup><a href="">[16]</a></sup> He also took a leading role in the action thriller <a href=""><i>The Jackal</i></a> (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.<sup><a href="">[19]</a></sup>

    Gere was named <a href=""><i>People</i></a> magazine's "<a href="">Sexiest Man Alive</a>" in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit films <a href=""><i>The Mothman Prophecies</i></a> (2002), <a href=""><i>Unfaithful</i></a> (2002), and the <a href="">Academy Award</a>-winning <a href="">musical film adaptation</a> <a href=""><i>Chicago</i></a> (2002),<sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> for which Gere won his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a>. Gere's <a href="">ballroom dancing</a> drama <a href=""><i>Shall We Dance?</i></a> (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.<sup><a href="">[20]</a></sup> His next film, <a href="">the book-to-screen adaptation</a> <a href=""><i>Bee Season</i></a> (2005), was a commercial failure.<sup><a href="">[24]</a></sup> Gere went on to co-star with <a href="">Jesse Eisenberg</a> and <a href="">Terrence Howard</a> in <a href=""><i>The Hunting Party</a> (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett in Todd Haynes' semi-biographical film about Bob Dylan, I'm Not There (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. He co-starred with Diane Lane in the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe (2008). The film was widely panned by critics[25] (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),[26] but grossed over $84 million worldwide.[27] The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a major film studio.

    Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major Hollywood studios, have made him unwelcome within Hollywood.[28] Gere embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood and instead appeared in independent films that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.[20] Gere was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in Arbitrage (2012), earning his fourth Golden Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews,[29] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cited Gere's performance as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".[30] Also in 2012, he received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Awards.[31][32] Gere had earlier received an award from the 34th Cairo International Film Festival in December 2010.[33]

    Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with Joseph Cedar's political drama Norman (2016). The film saw Gere portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish fixer. Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".[34] His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by RogerEbert.com[35] and was singled out as a worthy Academy Award contender by Variety.[36]

    Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in Runaway Bride. He studied tap for three months to shoot half a day of dancing for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in Chicago.[37] He also studied karate for An Officer and a Gentleman.[38]

    <p>
    Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.[39][40]
